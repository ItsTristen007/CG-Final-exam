This was added because I didn't want the scene to just be cubes. All that was used was the model all the texturing/shaders were done by me. This object gives the scene more personality and makes it feel more like Mario Kart 




Outlining/Vertex Coloring 

This was done because of two reasons. The first one was because it was needed by the rubric. But it also done to make the "players" stand out without needing any UI elements. This was done by taking the normals of the object and coloring on a offset of these normals to make an outline on the object. I also used vertex coloring on the edges of the roads. This was done because it made these roads pop out more and it would also give the player a more defined edge of the roads so they would know how big the road is. 


Hologram 

This was done for the item boxes to make them like newer Mario Kart games. It matches the style of these newer games and also for this recreation it would also help the player see through the boxes so their vision wouldn't get blocked by them. This was done by getting the normals and making them semi transparent while also having a toggle on how much power the transparency could be 


Scrolling Texture

This was done to give the roads a more rainbow style to them. I thought it was fitting because in the screenshot for the exam the course was rainbow road. There are 3 scrolling textures for different parts of the course. Each of them scroll to different colors simulating a rainbow road. This was done by using the sin function to move the texture over the object while also having a glow added to it to make it pop. 


LUT 

This was added to the game because I wanted to give the scene the option to pop more. This was done by adjusting the different filters in photoshop until I got something that I liked for the game. In unity this was added by using shader code to take parts of the LUT and display the values over the camera giving a nice filter.
